An Api stubbing nodejs module based on mongoosejs schemas.

This is not a production piece of code. It is really dirty and not tested.

This is a tiny module to stub out quickly API's based on mongoosejs Schemas. It provides out of the box pagination and filterting for  basic REST endpoints (get, get/:id, put/:id, delete/:id, post).
